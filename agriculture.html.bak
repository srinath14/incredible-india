<body>
<p>Agriculture has a significant role in socio-economic fabric of India. 
Here Sikh farmers are deploying a tractor and cane crusher to produce and distribute free cane juice on an Indian festival.</p>
<p>Several festivals relate to Agriculture in India. Holi - the festival of colours - is celebrated across north India as the coming of spring. It is celebrated with bonfires, meeting friends and strangers, playful painting each other with colours.</p>
<ul>
<li type="circle">Indian agriculture is diverse, ranging from impoverished farm villages to developed farms utilising modern agricultural technologies. </li>

<h2>Irrigation</h2>
<ul>
<li type="disc">Irrigation in India refers to the supply of water from Indian rivers, tanks, wells, canals and other artificial projects for the purpose of cultivation and agricultural activities. In country such as India, 64% of cultivated land is dependent on monsoons.The economic significance of irrigation in India is namely, to reduce over dependence on monsoons, advanced agricultural productivity, bringing more land under cultivation, reducing instability in output levels, creation of job opportunities, electricity and transport facilities, control of floods and prevention of droughts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Agriculture and colonialism</h2>
<ul>
<li type="square">Over 2500 years ago, Indian farmers had discovered and begun farming many spices and sugarcane. It was in India, between the sixth and fourth centuries BC, that the Persians, followed by the Greeks, discovered the famous reeds that produce honey without bees being grown.</li>
<li>As of 2011, India had a large and diverse agricultural sector, accounting, on average, for about 16% of GDP and 10% of export earnings. India's arable land area of 159.7 million hectares (394.6 million acres) is the second largest in the world, after the United States. Its gross irrigated crop area of 82.6 million hectares (215.6 million acres) is the largest in the world. 
</li>
<h2>Indian agriculture since 1947</h2>
<ul>
<li type="circle">Over 50 years since its independence, India has made immense progress towards food security. Indian population has tripled, but food-grain production more than quadrupled: there has thus been substantial increase in available food-grain per capita.</li>
<li type="circle">Prior to the mid-1960s India relied on imports and food aid to meet domestic requirements. However, two years of severe drought in 1965 and 1966 convinced India to reform its agricultural policy, and that India could not rely on foreign aid and foreign imports for food security.</li>
<li type="circle">With agricultural policy success in wheat, India's Green Revolution technology spread to rice. However, since irrigation infrastructure was very poor, Indian farmer innovated with tube-wells, to harvest ground water. </li>
<li  type="circle">When gains from the new technology reached their limits in the states of initial adoption, the technology spread in the 1970s and 1980s to the states of eastern India â€” Bihar,[Orissa] and West Bengal. </li>
<li type="circle">The lasting benefits of the improved seeds and new technology extended principally to the irrigated areas which account for about one-third of the harvested crop area. </li>

</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<li>Indian agriculture is diverse, ranging from impoverished farm villages to developed farms utilising modern agricultural technologies. This image shows a farming community in a more prosperous part of India.</li>
<li>As of 2011, India had a large and diverse agricultural sector, accounting, on average, for about 16% of GDP and 10% of export earnings. India's arable land area of 159.7 million hectares (394.6 million acres) is the second largest in the world, after the United States. Its gross irrigated crop area of 82.6 million hectares (215.6 million acres) is the largest in the world. India is among the top three global producers of many crops, including wheat, rice, pulses, cotton, peanuts, fruits and vegetables. Worldwide, as of 2011, India had the largest herds of buffalo and cattle, is the largest producer of milk and has one of the largest and fastest growing poultry industries.</li>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<img src=" D:\pro\incredibleindia\image\indian-agriculture-sector.jpg">
<li><p>As Per the 2010 FAO world agriculture statistics, India is the world's largest producer of many fresh fruits and vegetables, milk, major spices, select fresh meats, select fibrous crops such as jute, several staples such as millets and castor oil seed.</p> </li>
<li><p>India is the second largest . producer of wheat and rice, the world's major food staples India is also the world's second or third largest producer of several dry fruits, agriculture-based textile raw materials, roots and tuber crops, pulses, farmed fish, eggs, coconut, sugarcane and numerous vegetables. India ranked within the world's five largest producers of over 80% of agricultural produce items, including many cash crops such as coffee and cotton, in 2010. India is also one of the world's five largest producers of livestock and poultry meat, with one of the fastest growth rates, as of 2011. </p></li>
<li><p>One report from 2008 claimed India's population is growing faster than its ability to produce rice and wheat.[5] Other recent studies claim India can easily feed its growing population, plus produce wheat and rice for global exports, if it can reduce food staple spoilage, improve its infrastructure and raise its farm productivity to those achieved by other developing countries such as Brazil and China. </p></li>
<li> <p>In fiscal year ending June 2011, with a normal monsoon season, Indian agriculture accomplished an all-time record production of 85.9 million tonnes of wheat, a 6.4% increase from a year earlier. Rice output in India also hit a new record at 95.3 million tonnes, a 7% increase from the year earlierLentils and many other food staples production also increased year over year. Indian farmers, thus produced about 71 kilograms of wheat and 80 kilograms of rice for every member of Indian population in 2011. The per capita supply of rice every year in India is now higher than the per capita consumption of rice every year in Japan.</p></li>
<li><p>India exported around 2 million metric tonnes of wheat and 2.1 million metric tonnes of rice in 2011 to Africa, Nepal, Bangladesh and other regions around the world.</p> </li>
<li><p>Aquaculture and catch fishery is amongst the fastest growing industries in India. Between 1990 and 2010, Indian fish capture harvest doubled, while aquaculture harvest tripled. In 2008, India was the world's sixth largest producer of marine and freshwater capture fisheries, and the second largest aquaculture farmed fish producer. India exported 600,000 metric tonnes of fish products to nearly half of all the world's countries.</p></li>
<li><p>India has shown a steady average nationwide annual increase in the kilograms produced per hectare for various agricultural items, over the last 60 years.</p></li>
<li><p>These gains have come mainly from India's green revolution, improving road and power generation infrastructure, knowledge of gains and reforms. Despite these recent accomplishments, agriculture in India has the potential for major productivity and total output gains, because crop yields in India are still just 30% to 60% of the best sustainable crop yields achievable in the farms of developed as well as other developing countries. dditionally, losses after harvest due to poor infrastructure and unorganised retail cause India to experience some of the highest food losses in the world.</p></li>
<h2>History</h2>
<li><p>The invention of agriculture is one of the great revolutions of human history. It includes the food production and domestication which led to significant changes in human society, population increase and biological changes. However, this revolution is best demonstrated at Margaretha (Period-I Neolithic period) in which the sense of the revolution ultimately set the platform for the rise of urbanisation in the Indian Subcontinent. In the period of the Neolithic revolution (roughly 8000-5000 BCE.), agriculture was far from the dominant mode of support for human societies.</p></li>
