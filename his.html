<p>The history of India begins with evidence of human activity of Homo sapiens, as long as 75,000 years ago, or with earlier hominids including 
Homo erectus from about 500,000 years ago. The Indus Valley Civilization, which spread and flourished in the northwestern part of the Indian 
subcontinent from c. 3300 to 1300 BCE in present-day Pakistan and northwest India, was the first major civilization in South Asia.

A sophisticated and technologically advanced urban culture developed in the Mature Harappan period, from 2600 to 1900 BCE. 
This civilization collapsed at the start of the second millennium BCE and was later followed by the Iron Age Vedic Civilization, which extended
over much of the Indo-Gangetic plain and which witness the rise of major polities known as the Mahajanapadas. In one of these kingdoms, Magadha, 
Mahavira and Gautama Buddha were born in the 6th or 5th century BCE and propagated their Shramanic philosophies.
Most of the subcontinent was conquered by the Maurya Empire during the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE. Various parts of India were ruled by numerous 
Middle kingdoms for the next 1,500 years.</p><br/>

<p>The "Late-Classical Age" in India began after the end of the Gupta Empire and the collapse of the Harsha Empire in the 7th century CE,
 and ended with the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in the south in the 16th century, due to pressure from Islamic invaders to the north.
This period produced some of India's finest art, considered the epitome of classical development, and the development of the main spiritual
and philosophical systems which continued to be in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. King Harsha of Kannauj succeeded in reuniting northern 
India during his reign in the 7th century, after the collapse of the Gupta dynasty. His kingdom collapsed after his death.

<p>The history of the Republic of India began on 26 January 1950. The country became an independent nation within the British Commonwealth on 15
August 1947. Concurrently the Muslim-majority northwest and east of British India was separated into the Dominion of Pakistan, by the partition 
of India. The partition led to a population transfer of more than 10 million people between India and Pakistan and the death of about one million 
people. Nationalist leader Jawaharlal Nehru became the first Prime Minister of India and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel became the Deputy Prime Minister
of India and its Minister of Home Affairs. But the most powerful moral leader Mahatma Gandhi accepted no office. The new constitution of 1950 made
India a secular and a democratic state. It has a Hindu majority, a large Muslim minority, and numerous other religious minorities including Sikhs and Christians.
The nation faced religious violence, casteism, naxalism, terrorism and regional separatist insurgencies, 
especially in Jammu and Kashmir and northeastern India. India has unresolved territorial disputes with China, which, in 1962,
escalated into the Sino-Indian War, and with Pakistan, which resulted in wars in 1947, 1965, 1971 and 1999. India was neutral in the Cold War,
but purchased its military weapons from the Soviet Union, while its arch-foe Pakistan was closely tied to the United States.
